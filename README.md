# Gravity-and-JavaScript

I recently participated in the "Gravity-and-JavaScript" workshop, where we used the Matter.js library to delve into the principles of gravity through JavaScript programming. We created dynamic physics simulations, which provided hands-on experience in coding gravitational interactions and deepened our understanding of fundamental physics concepts in a digital environment.
